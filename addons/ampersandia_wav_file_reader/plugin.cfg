name="WAVFileReader"
description="A simple reader for .wav files that allows you to load most .wav files from the user's file system. It includes simple error handling features for both file system errors as well as WAV parse errors.

This plugin uses a simple parser to know where the audio data starts, instead of naively assuming that this data will be found at byte 44 (which is not guaranteed).

Features:
* Load most .wav files into godot from outside the res:// directory
* Simple error handling for those who want their .wav file loading to never fail
* The ability to obtain the file's abstract syntax tree

Known problems:
* If your data is in PCM8 unsigned format, the audio will not load properly as this parser currently does not convert it into signed data.
* I have no idea how compressed WAV files work, so I am not certain that they are properly implemented"
